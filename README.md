## 💻 Code & AI Assistance

This app was built with initial guidance from AI (OpenAI's ChatGPT) for structuring the codebase, setting up React components, and handling API integration. Here’s how AI contributed to the project:

1. **Starting Code**: AI provided the foundational code for core components and error handling.
2. **Using States**: AI taught me how to use states in the app to manage screens.
3. **Debugging Support**: AI helped troubleshoot some API integration issues.

While the bulk of the initial setup was AI-generated, I personalized and fine-tuned the app to make it look good and more user friendly. This README was also mostly generated by AI.

## 💡 Future Enhancements

Planned updates to enhance the user experience and add even more functionality:

- **Bookmarking**: Allow users to save articles for later viewing.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Tag articles with sentiment ratings to quickly gauge the tone.
- **Built-in translation**: Translate articles from other languages, instead of relying on the automatic google translation in the news page.
